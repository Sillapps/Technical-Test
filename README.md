# Goal
Develop an app that retrieves and displays a list of photo albums.
When clicking on an album, it displays a grid of photos it contains.

# Your app should perform the following
Retrieve data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and displays them in two screens :

Album list screen
- Each row represents an album, with two texts: one for the album name and one for the name of its author
- The albums must be sorted alphabetically
- On a tap on an album, the user is taken to the Gallery screen

Gallery screen
- Displays a grid of the photos contained in the albums
- The user can scroll the grid

# Delivery
- Github project
- Short document where you specify
  - Time passed on this project
  - Libraries used and why
  - Particular practices (you consider as best) you use or UI, architecture, or code quality in general

# Last but not least
The main goal is to evaluate how do you approach an issue more than a skill demonstration. However skills matter so we will paid a particular attention on your code quality.
So if your app crash... :)
